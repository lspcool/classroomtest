# Vision for GitHub Classroom

### Phase 1: Build a strong, extensible ecosystem:
* Expand content platform with Assignments and teacher content contributions.
* LTI and Google Classroom integration.
* GitHub Classroom API.

### Phase 2: Classroom allows teachers to assess student work with live feedback:
* First-class support for teacher feedback.
* Leverage existing tooling to auto-grade student submissions.
* LMS integration can provide a fully automated pipeline from submission to grades in teachers' LMS.


## Roadmap

Phase | Theme 1      | Theme 2      | Theme 3  |
------| ---------------- | -----------------| ----------- |
Extensible ecosystem | “I want to integrate Classroom into my existing automated tooling.” |  “I want less manual work when using Classroom with my LMS.” | “I want to find the best exercises for my course.”
Live feedback | "I want to be able to provide feedback to my students via GitHub.com."| "I want to run my testing suite on student submissions to grade automatically." |
